// Migration table, keyed by the version a save is migrating FROM.
// v1 -> v2: tick bar feature added tickDurationSeconds (see MIGRATIONS[1]).
// v2 -> v3: research feature (docs/plans/2026-07-03-research-plan.md, Task 3)
// added `research` to GameState. Saves made before that field existed need
// it backfilled to a fresh, not-yet-started alloySynthesis entry.
// v3 -> v4: HOTFIX. The same research feature also added a 4th module/
// resource pair (modules.synthesizer, resources.alloys) to MODULES/
// RESOURCE_KEY, but MIGRATIONS[2] only backfilled `research` -- it never
// backfilled these two fields. Any save migrated through the *unpatched*
// MIGRATIONS[2] already got re-stamped as v3 by the next autosave (serialize()
// always writes the current SAVE_VERSION), but still has an object literal
// missing the `synthesizer`/`alloys` keys entirely -- not just a numeric
// zero. That undefined count makes costFor() -> Math.pow(x, undefined) ->
// NaN, which makes affordable = ore >= NaN always false: Synthesizer looks
// permanently unaffordable no matter how much ore you have.
// Because those already-v3-stamped saves will never re-run MIGRATIONS[2]
// (their version field already reads 3), patching MIGRATIONS[2] cannot fix
// them. Per Ops §8.E.1 (never edit a shipped migration body), this repair
// has to be a new v3 -> v4 step instead, so it runs for both the
// already-corrupted v3 saves and any v1/v2 save still chaining through.
// Per Ops §8.E.1: MIGRATIONS[1] and MIGRATIONS[2] are never edited again now that they're shipped.
